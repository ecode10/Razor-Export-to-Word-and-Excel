A simple project that you can export to excel and word without using nuget package or pay. All for free

Look into the pages:
- Word.cshtml

On the top of these pages I changed the header and content type.
You can process everything and when the page is ready, the page will be converted to Word or Excel and download it. All page will be converted to Word or Excel.
